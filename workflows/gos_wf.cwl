  This workflow is based on the MGnify tools and subworkflows to address the needs 
  for the analysis of the metagenomics data derived from the marine 
  Genomic Observatories (https://www.embrc.eu/newsroom/news/emo-bon-first-coordinated-long-term-genomic-biodiversity-observatory-europe).
  It returns the taxonomic profile of a sample based on RNA prediction of its raw-data as well as its functional annotation based on them. 
  It may also build the assembly of the metagenomic data using the MEGAHIT algorithm. The assembly can then be further analysed through 
  the "assembly" pipeline of MGnify.

  # Pre-process
  overrepresentation_analysis: 
    type: boolean
    default: false 
    doc: | 
        fastp may run an overrepresentation analysis, by default it will not. Overrepresented are considered sequences which appear more than expected in a .fastq file and are a result of certain sequencing artifacts such as PCR over-duplication, polyG tails and adapter contamination. 

  detect_adapter_for_pe:
    type: boolean
    default: false
    doc: | 
        fastp argument for adapter sequence auto-detection. By default, it is disabled since the adapters can be trimmed by overlap analysis. however, it usually results in a slightly cleaner output, since the overlap analysis may fail due to sequencing errors or adapter dimers. You may use it only if your adapters are among Illumina TruSeq adapters; fastp contains a limited number of built-in known adapter sequences for better auto-detection. For more, see https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp.

  force_polyg_tail_trimming: 
    type: boolean
    default: false 
    doc: |
        fastp argument that forces polyG tail trimming; a polyG tail is the result of the no light signal, suggesting for G, as the sequencing by synthesis proceeds to subsequent cycles and the signal strength of each DNA cluster becomes progressively weaker. By default trimming is automatically enabled for Illumina NextSeq/NovaSeq data. 

  disable_trim_poly_g: 
    type: boolean
    default: true
    doc: | 
        fastp argument to disable polyG tail trimming. In fastp, by default, trimming is automatically enabled for Illumina NextSeq/NovaSeq data. In metaGOflow however, by default this is disabled, ie. set as True.

  overlap_len_require:
    type: int
    default: 30
    doc: |
      fastp parameter setting the minimum length to detect overlapped region of PE reads. This will affect overlap analysis based PE merge, adapter trimming and correction. By default its value is set to 30. 

  qualified_phred_quality: 
    type: int?
    doc: | 
        fast parameter setting the quality value that a base is qualified. Default 15 means phred quality >=Q15 is qualified.

  unqualified_percent_limit: 
    type: int?
    doc: |
        fastp parameter setting the percentage of bases allowed to be unqualified (0~100). Default 40 means 40%.


  min_length_required:
    type: int
    default: 100 
    doc: |
        fastp parameter setting a theshold where reads shorter than that will be discarded. In metaGOflow, default is 100.

  cut_right: 
    type: boolean
    default: true 
    doc: |
        fastp parameter that moves a sliding window from front to tail, if meet one window with mean quality < threshold, drop the bases in the window and the right part, and then stop. Mean quality for this step is by default 20.

  base_correction:
    type: boolean 
    default: false
    doc: |
        fastp parameter that enables base correction in overlapped regions, default is disabled (False)

  # Assembly step 
  min-contig-len: 
    type: int?
    doc: |
        MEGAHIT parameter setting the minimum length of contigs to output. Default is 200

  memory: 
    type: float?
    doc: | 
        MEGAHIT parameter setting the maximum memory to make available to MEGAHIT, as a percentage of available system memory (optional, default = 0.9 or 90%)

  # CGC
  cgc_chunk_size: 
    type: int
    default: 50
    doc: | 
        Size of chunks to split reads into for the gene caller step.
