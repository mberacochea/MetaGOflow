Dependencies
------------

To run metaGOflow you need to make sure you have the following set on your computing environment first:

- python3 [v 3.8+]
- `Docker <https://www.docker.com>`_ [v 19.+] or `Singularity <https://apptainer.org>`_ [v 3.7.+] / `Apptainer <https://apptainer.org>`_ [v 1.+]
- `cwltool <https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool>`_ [v 3.+]
- `rdflib <https://rdflib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ [v 6.+]
- `rdflib-jsonld <https://pypi.org/project/rdflib-jsonld/>`_ [v 0.6.2]
- `ro-crate-py <https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate-py>`_ [v 0.7.0]
- `pyyaml <https://pypi.org/project/PyYAML/>`_ [v 6.0]
- `Node.js <https://nodejs.org/>`_ [v 10.24.0+]
- Available storage ~160GB for databases

You may either ensure you have those locally or you may use a conda environment we have built including them (``conda_environment.yml``, `url <https://github.com/emo-bon/MetaGOflow/blob/eosc-life-gos/conda_environment.yml>`_). 

On top of those, disk requirements need to be considered and depending on the analysis you are about to run they vary.
Indicatively, you may have a look at the metaGOflow publication for computing resources used in various cases.




Installation
------------

Get source code:


.. code-block:: bash 

  git clone https://github.com/emo-bon/MetaGOflow.git


Setup environment:

Get dependencies to run metaGOflow:

.. code-block:: bash 

  conda env create -f conda_environment.yml


This will create a ``conda`` environment called ``metagoflow``.
By running ``conda env list``  you will see your new environment.
In case ``conda`` is not already installed on your computing system, you may follow 
the instructions to get it `here <https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html>`_.


In case Singularity runs fail with an error message mentioning that a `.sif` file is missing, 
you need to force-pull the images to be used from metaGOflow. 
To do so, you may run the ``get_singularity_images.sh`` [`url <https://github.com/emo-bon/pipeline-v5/blob/develop/Installation/get_singularity_images.sh>`_] script
that you shall find under the ``Installation`` folder.

.. code-bloc:: bash
    cd Installation
    bash get_singularity_images.sh

.. attention:: Besides the database storage, ``metaGOflow`` requires a significant storage space during its performance. 
  The final data products are a few megabytes, however maybe more than 1 TB might be needed during its run.
