# run the following parts of the workflow. 
# For example, you have ran the quality contron and the rna prediction steps
# and you would like to go just for the assembly step. 

# Currently, because of CWL-limitations (see https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwl-v1.3/issues/3)
# you need to provide values to some of the following variables even if it is not to be used.
# To that end, we provide pseudo-files under the /test_input folder you may use
